* firstly, i linked my stylesheet to my HTML file, to setup my resume 
for styling.

- i added a div element to divide my resume into segments and them made
it lay side by side to each other by using display flex.

- I used border element to make the segments visible, and i added some 
padding and margin to the border.

- I added some margins to the whole body to put it on a good position.

- I added some backgroung color to the borders, and some border radius
to the pictures.

* secondly i added media query to my my resume suit well on different 
screen sizes.

- i adjust the margins and paddings of specific screen sizes for a better
user experience.

* I reserch on some good resume template while before i started my design.

- i had to rearrange the order of my resume content to suit the template

- then i proceeded with the steps above.

* i had little or no challenges in this assignment, because i am quite 
familiar with css.

* I would practice more with css, to get more better on it and to learn
more way to style anything.
